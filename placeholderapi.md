# ðŸ“‚ PlaceholderAPI

PlaceholderAPI is a plugin for Minecraft servers that allows for the creation and usage of custom placeholders in various plugins, including TNT-Tag. These placeholders allow server administrators to display various information about players, games, and more in a convenient and dynamic way.

TNT-Tag has several placeholders available for use with PlaceholderAPI:

`%tnttag_wins%` This placeholder displays the number of times a player has won a game of TNT-Tag. This can be useful for displaying player statistics or creating leaderboards.

`%tnttag_timestagged%` This placeholder displays the number of times a player has been tagged by TNT blocks during a game of TNT-Tag. This can be useful for displaying player performance or creating anti-cheat measures.

`%tnttag_tags%` This placeholder displays the number of players a player has tagged with TNT blocks during a game of TNT-Tag. This can be useful for displaying player performance or creating anti-cheat measures.

`%tnttag_top_wins_X%` This placeholder displays the player's position in the top X players with the most wins in TNT-Tag. Replace X with the desired position (e.g., %tnttag\_top\_wins\_1% for the top player).

`%tnttag_top_timestagged_X%` This placeholder displays the player's position in the top X players who have been tagged the most in TNT-Tag. Replace X with the desired position (e.g., %tnttag\_top\_timestagged\_1% for the top player).

`%tnttag_top_tags_X%` This placeholder displays the player's position in the top X players who have tagged the most players in TNT-Tag. Replace X with the desired position (e.g., %tnttag\_top\_tags\_1% for the top player).

`%tnttag_arena_ARENA_NAME_minPlayers%` This placeholder displays the minimum number of players required for the specified arena to start. Replace ARENA\_NAME with the name of the arena.

`%tnttag_arena_ARENA_NAME_maxPlayers%` This placeholder displays the maximum number of players allowed in the specified arena. Replace ARENA\_NAME with the name of the arena.

`%tnttag_arena_ARENA_NAME_survivors%` This placeholder displays the current number of survivors in the specified arena. Replace ARENA\_NAME with the name of the arena.

`%tnttag_arena_ARENA_NAME_taggers%` This placeholder displays the current number of taggers in the specified arena. Replace ARENA\_NAME with the name of the arena.

`%tnttag_arena_ARENA_NAME_spectators%` This placeholder displays the current number of spectators in the specified arena. Replace ARENA\_NAME with the name of the arena.

`%tnttag_arena_ARENA_NAME_state%` This placeholder displays the current state of the specified arena (e.g., waiting, running, etc.). Replace ARENA\_NAME with the name of the arena.



To use these placeholders, server administrators must have PlaceholderAPI and TNT-Tag installed on their Minecraft server. Once both plugins are installed, the placeholders can be used in various plugins that support PlaceholderAPI, such as chat plugins or scoreboard plugins. To use a placeholder, simply insert the placeholder text (e.g. %tnttag\_wins%) into the appropriate plugin configuration file or command.

In conclusion, PlaceholderAPI placeholders provide a powerful tool for displaying various player statistics and game information in TNT-Tag. By using these placeholders, server administrators can create dynamic displays and leaderboards that enhance the player experience and improve server management.
