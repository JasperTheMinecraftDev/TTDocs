# Arena setup

To create an arena in TNT-Tag, you will need to follow the steps outlined below:

1. Type "/tnttag create" and give a name for the arena. The plugin will respond with "The name of the arena is set!".
2. Next, you will need to enter the minimum number of players required to start the game. The plugin will respond with "The amount of players needed to start is set!".
3. After that, you will need to enter the maximum number of players that the arena can hold. The plugin will respond with "The amount of players that this arena can hold is set!".
4. Go to the lobby location and type "setlobby" in the chat. The plugin will respond with "The lobby location is set!".
5. Go to the start location and type "setstart" in the chat. The plugin will respond with "The start location is set!".

At this point, the arena creation process is complete and you can begin playing TNT-Tag. The setup process uses chat commands to make it easier to set up an arena, so you don't need to remember coordinates or use complicated commands.

Congratulations, you have successfully set up an arena for TNT-Tag!\

Optional: Use cool signs to let your players join an arena.\
To create a TNT-Tag sign, you need to have the "tnttag.createsigns" permission. Once you have the permission, you can place a sign and add the following text to the first line:

`[TT]`

The second line of the sign should be the name of the map that the sign will be associated with. For example:

`Map1`

The third and fourth lines of the sign will automatically be filled with the number of players in the game and the maximum number of players allowed in the game.

Joining a TNT-Tag Game

To join a TNT-Tag game, simply right-click on a TNT-Tag sign that has been created by someone else. The sign should have the following text on the first line:

`[TT]`

The second line of the sign will indicate the name of the map that the sign is associated with. To join the game, simply right-click on the sign.

Removing a TNT-Tag Sign

To remove a TNT-Tag sign, you need to have the "tnttag.breaksigns" permission. Once you have the permission, you can break the sign to remove it or left click it. It's important to note that breaking a TNT-Tag sign will not stop the game that it is associated with.
